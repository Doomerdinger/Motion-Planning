You will have an entire class hour to present your final project.
(He probably means 0.5 of a class hour = 20-25 minutes)

Final project presentations should include two key components: 
	1. A tutorial on the area you explored. This should educate the rest of us about the area of
		graphics you explored. In short, teach us some of what you learned working on your project.
	2. A demonstration of what you implemented. This should focus on how you applied your new knowledge.
